# Pong-in-OpenGL
Object Oriented Programming Project

The set of files is already compiled and the logic I implemented begins in App.cpp

Code lacks comments: 
This was a very early course during my education 
and we had not been taught the importance of comments in the basic programming courses
we had mostly focused on understanding how to code in general.

OpenGL template:
A template version of OpenGL was provided to me and is not of my creation. 

The following files were of my creation and represent a very early version 
of my code quality and formatting :
  - Pong.h/cpp
  - Paddle.h/cpp
  - Ball.h/cpp
  - TexRect.h/cpp (adapted from a prior assignment in the course)
